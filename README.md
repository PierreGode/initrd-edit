<H3>Ubuntu initrd Modification Script</H3>
This script is a utility designed to extract, modify, and recreate the initial ramdisk (initrd) file within an Ubuntu operating system. The initrd contains a temporary root filesystem loaded into memory during system boot. This filesystem includes essential drivers and tools that the system uses to mount the actual root filesystem.

<H3>How it Works</H3>
The script extracts the initrd file, allowing you to insert needed drivers into the appropriate directories, and then repacks the initrd for booting. The drivers should be placed in the /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/kernel/drivers/net/usb directory within the extracted initrd file structure.

<H3>Usage</H3>
The script presents an interactive menu guiding you through the processes of extracting an existing initrd file, creating a new initrd from the extracted content, and checking the file. Please ensure that the initrd file you wish to modify resides in the same directory as the script before running it.

<H3>Caution</H3>
Please note that the modifications performed by this script require a deep understanding of the Linux boot process and device drivers. Always test the modifications in a controlled environment before deploying them in a live setting. Be aware that inserting kernel modules and modifying initrd can significantly affect the boot process and the stability of the system.

<H3>Contribution</H3>
Contributions and improvements to the script are always welcome. Please make sure to test the changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
